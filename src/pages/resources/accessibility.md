## Free White Cane Program

The National Federation of the Blind has distributed more than 64,000 free white canes since 2008. The white cane gives blind people the ability to achieve a full and independent life, aiding in the opportunity to travel freely and safely. The organization started their free white cane program because they believe that no blind person should be without a white cane, regardless of his or her ability to pay for it.
