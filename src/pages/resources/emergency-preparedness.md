## Health Risk Passport Tool

If you found yourself in an emergency or a critical situation, would you be prepared? If you are a caregiver, would someone else know how to support the person you care for in your absence? Is there a written plan in place that describes the supports you or your loved one would need? Health Risk Screening, Inc. (HRS) offers a simple screening tool called "My Health Passport" that can be used as a guide to help people begin preparing for an emergency or a critical situation.
