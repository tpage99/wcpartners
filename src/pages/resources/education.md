## MPACT

Missouri Parents Act (MPACT) is a non-profit that serves children with disabilities, their families, and communities throughout the state. MPACT has served as Missouri’s federally-funded Parent Training and Information Center since 1988. MPACT also works in collaboration with, and receives funding from, the Missouri Department of Elementary and Secondary Education (DESE). Their primary goal is to assist parents in their effort to effectively advocate for their children’s educational rights and services. MPACT staff and volunteers are located throughout Missouri and work with public and private agencies, parent groups, professional organizations and advocacy groups to achieve that goal. MPACT is committed to excellence as they provide FREE services and assistance to parents, families, and youth. Parents of children with disabilities face challenges every day that other parents don’t have. It is often difficult to navigate the maze of special services and create a plan that will help children achieve successful outcomes through education.
