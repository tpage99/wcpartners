## Durable Power of Attorney

One alternative to guardianship is Durable Power of Attorney. There are different kinds of DPOA that allow for the individual to receive supports in specific areas while still allowing them to maintain their individual rights. The Missouri Bar (https://mobar.org) created [missourilawyershelp.org](http://missourilawyershelp.org/) to assist Missourians with legal resources and assistance. They have a dedicated page for Durable Power of Attorney for Health Care that can be helpful for families seeking out a means to help support individuals through health care decisions
