## Non-Emergency Medical Transportation

Non-Emergency Medical Transportation (NEMT) provides medical transportation to and from medical appointments at a low cost ($2 charged per medical appointment, whether trip is one-way or round trip - your ride **cannot** be denied if you are unable to pay the $2 fare).

### Who is eligible?

You must be on MO HealthNet or MO HealthNet Managed Care on the day of your appointment. People in a MO HealthNet Managed Care Health Plan get their NEMT services from the health plan. Some people on MO HealthNet or MO HealthNet Managed Care do not get NEMT services as part of their benefits. The NEMT program will let you know if your benefits do not cover NEMT.

If you need to be away from home overnight, the NEMT program may be able to help with meals and lodging. If a child under the age of 21 needs someone to go along, NEMT will only pay for the child and one parent or guardian. NEMT will only pay for other children or adults to ride along for specific circumstances on a case by case basis. Participants under the age of 17, must have a parent or guardian travel with them.

For more information about the NEMT program, visit this [FAQ page](https://dss.mo.gov/mhd/participants/pages/medtrans.htm) or call 1-866-269-5927 to schedule a ride. The call center is open Monday through Friday from 8am-5pm. To schedule an appointment you must call 5 calendar days before your appointment to give time for the ride to be arranged.
