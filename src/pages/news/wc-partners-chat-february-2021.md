# Welcome to WC Partners Chat

## Letter from the Executive Director

Welcome to February edition of WC Partners Chat. Missouri has met a lot of record-breaking events recently with the weather and I am ready for the warm-up. We have had a great start to our year and look forward to a variety of upcoming events. Please find featured in this month’s Newsletter Agency Spotlight Champion Athletes. Champion Athletes offers a wide range of activities and I know several of you already participate, but if you do not know what Champion Athletes is about be sure to check them out.

I also want to take the time to spotlight Tristan Jones and BBC. Please take a moment to read about Tristan and how BBC does a fantastic job with inclusion. Inclusion is something that we all strive toward for the individuals served by WC Partners and for those we don’t, whether it be in school or the community. It makes me to see how the collegiate level has truly embraced inclusion.

I would like to report that the advisory board now has an official name WC CAPEabilities. The board will be meeting once a month. I want to thank each of the current board members: Joyce Fenner, Chairman, Leann Nystrom, Vice Chairman, Danielle Boggs, Secretary, Brenda Salkil, member, Brenda Nease, member, Jennifer Moore, member, and Clyde Ross, member. If you are interested in learning more about WC CAPEabilities please give me a call.

### Meet Tristan!

Tristan worked with the BBC girls basketball team this season. He helped the coaches and players, and worked out with them some as well. Tristan was great at helping get what the team or coaches needed.

Tristan loves basketball! It was great that they asked Tristan to be part of their team. This was the first year in several years that they had a girls basketball team.

Thank you BBC for making Tristan a part of your team!
