# Welcome to WC Partners Chat

WC Partners Chat is a newsletter designed to not only bring you information about what is happening at WC Partners, but to also bring you resources and upcoming events you might be interested in. This month we are featuring information regarding Drury Music Therapy. Drury has been providing music therapy for a couple of years now with some awesome success. If you are interested in signing up for any Music Therapy session you can do so on our website, [https://www.wc-partners.net](/), under the Activities section. Please see the article about Music Therapy in this addition. Now on to other great information.

## Letter from the Executive Director

It has been one year since I became the Executive Director and I can truly say it has been a year of lots of changes due to COVID. The Support Coordinators and I truly miss seeing you face-to-face or having activities for you to participate. This year we are hoping that COVID will calm down and we will be able to offer more social gatherings and get back to normal face-to-face meetings. Even with COVID dampening lots of activities, this past year has not been all bad for WC Partners. WC Partners Board has moved toward purchasing land in order to build a new agency building, as well as, working with others to build accessible housing. We are excited that this will bring apartments that are accessible and meet the needs of many of you wanting to live more independently. WC Partners has also created a new advisory board (still working on the official name) to assist with becoming a 501c3 Organization. This will allow for fundraising and other activities that will benefit individuals served by WC Partners. Again, stay tuned for more information on this exciting new board.

This year WC Partners goal is to work toward offering activities again, with safety always the priority. We would like to Introduce WC Fit Life starting April 1st. Fit Life will have two different components available, but you can participate in both if you like. The first component, Goal Getters, is designed for individuals that want to work on learning to eat healthy, lose weight, set realistic goals, and have a support group as your cheerleaders. Sessions will be held weekly and will be offered at two different times for convenience. The second component, Making Strides, will be focusing on being physically active. This group will start off with walking and then other physical activities will be added as available. Please look on our website to sign-up.

Lastly, I want WC Partners Chat to be successful and useful to all. If you think of something that we could feature in the newsletter, please let us know. Thank you to all of our individuals, parents, guardians, and direct care staff.

Katrina Detherow

## Drury Music Therapy

Webster County Partners and the Center for Music Therapy and Wellness have partnered together to offer a weekly music therapy group at no cost to group members. Using music as a motivating and non-threatening tool, this therapeutic group works on social, cognitive, behavioral, motor, and emotional goals. Group members engage in active music making, dancing and movement, songwriting, musical games, and singing together.

This group is held each week on Wednesdays from 4:15-5:05 PM on Zoom. We currently have openings to join the group and we would love to have you join us! If you have any questions about music therapy or want to learn more about what a group looks like, please contact Abigail Loyd, MT-BC at [abigail@cmtw.rocks](mailto:abigail@cmtw.rocks). We hope you will join us and rock out with our music therapy group!
