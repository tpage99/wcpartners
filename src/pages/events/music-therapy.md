WC Partners has partnered with the Center for Music Therapy and Wellness to bring music therapy classes to Marshfield. Once a week, practitioners from the Center for Music Therapy and Wellness come and engage with individuals we serve to promote communication and interaction through music therapy.

Music therapy is an evidenced-based practice that utilizes music as a tool to address non-musical goals and objectives. Music therapy has been found to be effective in addressing skills with people with developmental disabilities of all ages, including improved social skills, improved emotional self-regulation, improved self-esteem, increased attention, improved cognitive functioning, and many more positive benefits.

Classes are on Wednesdays and spots are limited, so [contact your Support Coordinator](/sc-contact/) in order to learn more or [click here to sign up for this class](/events/sign-up).
