## Music Therapy

Classes did start for this session in-person, however the Department of Mental Health placed Webster County on a remote monitoring services only advisory effective September 2, 2020. To learn more about this advisory and the current status for counties across Missouri, visit [DMH's dedicated webpage](https://dmh.mo.gov/dev-disabilities/covid-19-information/county-status) for this information.

Current Music Therapy sessions started Wednesday, September 2, 2020. These classes are provided at no cost to individuals receiving services with WC Partners. Classes for the current 8-week session are at capacity, but if you are interested in finding out about future sessions or want to sign up to be placed on waitlist, [please visit our sign-up form here](https://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=rHl3xfiVYUypCCivdEeGZlACl5a-Wa9GqWSl2_5J2o9UMDNZUTZNTFlSU1pJRURIUkVPOFNKTkVUVi4u).

Come in costume and get a treat! Staff will be ready to give you some delicious goodies. You don't even have to get out of the car. We encourage you to roll down your window and wave ðŸ‘‹ðŸ‘‹ðŸ‘‹
