## Music Therapy

WC Partners has partnered with the Center for Music Therapy and Wellness to bring music therapy classes to Marshfield.

You can [learn more about Music Therapy here](/events/music-therapy).

## Art Classes

We're having art classes again! WC Partners will be hosting guided painting classes at WC Partners' office that is free for individuals our office supports. Supplies will be provided. Art classes will occur on the 2nd and 4th Friday of each month. Classes will be limited to 8 participants. Please only plan for one parent/staff per individual.

You may sign-up for more than one class or multiple classes each month, but priority will be given to those who have not yet been able to participate that month. For example, if you sign up for both classes in April and also want to sign up in May, you will be able to attend the classes in May if they are not full with others who were not able to participate in April. This will ensure everyone has the opportunity to participate in limited seating classes.
