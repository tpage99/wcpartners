# Holiday Celebration

Join WC Partners for a Holiday Celebration! We'll be making crafts all while enjoying treats and holiday cheer!

Both online and in-person participation is available. Please indicate if you would like to participate in-person, as limited seating will be made available in order to socially distance. Online participation will be through Microsoft Teams or you can choose to pick up your supplies and complete at a time that is convenient for you as a family activity.

For in-person participation, masks will be required and gloves will be provided. Individuals participating will be limited to one support staff and/or parent. Time slots will be limited to 12 individuals each for in-person. If a time slot fills up, it will be on a first-come-first-serve basis so sign up as soon as possible! A Covid-19 pre-screening tool can be completed online or in-person when you attend. Link to complete the pre-screening tool will be sent to the email provided two days before the event or you can view ahead of time [here](/events/covid-19-waiver).

Deadline to apply is November 30, 2020 to ensure we have sufficient supplies available. [Sign-up here](https://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=rHl3xfiVYUypCCivdEeGZlACl5a-Wa9GqWSl2_5J2o9UQ0VQWURROVBRUEQwMTZKSTgxSTc1N0dVMC4u) or click the image below.
