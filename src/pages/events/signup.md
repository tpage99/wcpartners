## Drive-Thru Trick-or-Treat

Trick-or-treat looks a little different this year thanks to Covid-19, but we would still love to see you and your costumes! WC Partners will be handing out treats at our office for individuals we serve. Please note if you are signed up for Virtual Online Bingo, you may only get one treat bag.

Come in costume and get a treat! Staff will be ready to give you some delicious goodies. You don't even have to get out of the car. We encourage you to roll down your window and wave ðŸ‘‹ðŸ‘‹ðŸ‘‹

We will be handing out treats at the office from 3:30pm-5pm on Thursday, October 29th. Swing by and say hi!
