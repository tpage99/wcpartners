The Missouri Division of Developmental Disabilities regional Advocacy Specialist promotes self-determination and inclusion by coordinating Project STIR trainings in their region. The training is designed to empower people with developmental disabilities. It provides the practical, “how to” tools necessary for anyone who is interested in being a self-advocate and leader in making choices and decisions about how they live their lives.

The training is based on Speak Up Guide which was developed by The Carolina Institute for Developmental Disabilities (CIDD), and has been adapted with permission for Missouri. For more information visit www.self-advocate.org . Project STIR was updated in 2017 to includes LifeCourse Tools which was taken with permission from www.lifecoursetools.com, a free online resource from Missouri Family to Family © UMKC Institute for Human Development, UCEDD 2012-2017.
