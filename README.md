## Notes

### Events

Events on events page are in json located in the data folder ( src > data > events.json). Specific events are broken down in markdown files located in the _events_ folder ( src > pages > events) - go figure ðŸ˜‚. This is the URL reference for a "Learn more" link. Just a quick landing page or link back to a full page like the About page for board meeting events that get posted. List iterates over the following:

```{
